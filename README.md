tiny healthcheck library for akka-http with [Kubernetes liveness/readiness probe][k8sprobe] support.

## Installation
You need to activate [sbt-bintray](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-bintray) plugin first. And then, You will add it to your build by including these lines in your sbt file.  Please refer to download badge above for the latest version.

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("everpeace","maven")
  
libraryDependencies += "com.github.everpeace" %% "healthchecks-core" % <version>
  
// when you want kubernetes liveness/readiness probe support.
libraryDependencies += "com.github.everpeace" %% "healthchecks-k8s-probes" % <version>
```

## Getting Started
- [Simple healthcheck endpoint](#simple-healthcheck-endpoint)
- [Kubernetes liveness/readiness probe endpoints](#kubernetes-livenessreadiness-probe-endpoints)

### Simple healthcheck endpoint
All you need to give is just health check function returning cats `ValidationNel[String, Unit]`.

```scala
  import akka.actor.ActorSystem
  import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer
  import akka.http.scaladsl.Http
  import akka.http.scaladsl.model.HttpRequest
  import cats.syntax.validated._
  import scala.concurrent.Future
  import scala.util.Random

  implicit val system       = ActorSystem()
  implicit val materializer = ActorMaterializer()
  implicit val ec           = system.dispatcher

  import com.github.everpeace.healthchecks._
  import com.github.everpeace.healthchecks.route._

  // defining sync/async healthchecks
  val simple = healthCheck(name = "simple") {
    if (Random.nextBoolean()) healthy else "Unlucky!".invalidNel
  }

  val simpleAsync = asyncHealthCheck("simpleAsync") {
    Future {
      if (Random.nextBoolean()) healthy else "Unlucky!".invalidNel
    }
  }

  // start web server listening "localhost:8888/health"
  val serverBinding = Http().bindAndHandle(
    handler = HealthCheckRoutes.health(simple, simpleAsync),
    interface = "localhost",
    port = 8888
  )

  val response = Http().singleRequest(HttpRequest(uri = "http://localhost:8888/health"))

  // status code is 200(OK) if healthy, 503(Service Unavailable) if unhealthy.
  // response body is empty by default for performance.
  // pass '?full=true' query parameter to see full check result as json. it would be similar to below.
  // Please see com.github.everpeace.healthchecks.HealthRoutesTest for various response patterns.
  // {
  //   "status": "healthy",
  //   "check_results": [
  //     { "name": "simple", "severity": "Fatal", "status": "healthy", "messages": [] },
  //     { "name": "simpleAsync", "severity": "Fatal", "status": "healthy", "messages": [] }
  //   ]
  // }
```

### Kubernetes liveness/readiness probe endpoints
It supports to setup kubernetes liveness/readiness probe really easily like this.  You con configure probe paths and binding setting by typesafe config (i.e. application.conf).  Please refer [reference.conf](k8s-probes/src/main/resources/reference.conf) for details.

```scala
  import akka.actor.ActorSystem
  import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer
  import scala.concurrent.Future

  implicit val system       = ActorSystem()
  implicit val materializer = ActorMaterializer()
  implicit val ec           = system.dispatcher

  import com.github.everpeace.healthchecks._
  import com.github.everpeace.healthchecks.k8s._
  
  // by default, listening localhost:8086
  // and probe paths are
  //   GET /live
  //   GET /ready
  val probeBinding = bindAndHandleProbes(
    readinessProbe(healthCheck(name = "readiness_check")(healthy)),
    livenessProbe(asyncHealthCheck(name = "liveness_check")(Future(healthy)))
  )
```

Then you can set kubernetes liveness/readiness probe in the kubernetes manifest like below:

```yaml
...
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /live
      port: 8086
    initialDelaySeconds: 3
    periodSeconds: 3
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /ready
      port: 8086
    initialDelaySeconds: 3
    periodSeconds: 3
...
```
